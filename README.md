Muse Monitor
======================


Note that this system was created during my sophomore year in undergraduate. The system was created for an application development contest that provided 7 weeks of development time. My first 2-3 weeks was used to research the Muse Headband, define the designs, determine the fall and seizure detection algorithms, and determine variables for the detection algorithms through manual testing. The middle two weeks was a break to work on school work. The last (and only) two weeks were used for actual implementation/development based on the design previously created. Therefore the code for the system is not production code, and is in need of refactoring. If studying the code, be sure to keep the previous statement in mind.
